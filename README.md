## Features

- Lightweight bed carriage assembly with carbon fiber components
- Cross frame design focused on stifness and stability
- Low center of gravity
- AWD stepper configuration for the Y axis 
- 235 mm^2 x 200mm maximum build volume (easily expandable to other sizes)
    - 200 mm^2 carbon fiber bed for high speed setup
- Optimised for daily print speeds of 400-600 mm/s with 20.000 mm/s^2 acceleration
- Motion system capable of 1.000 mm/s speed with 100.000 mm/s^2 acceleration
- Maximum volumetric flow rate ~49 mm^3/s
- Build using 30 series T-slot extrusion with parts up to 3090
- All bracket assembly
- Geinune high quality motion system components
- All based on MGN12H Rails with high preload
- Fully belt driven with minimal belt paths
- 9mm 2GT belt in symmetrical configuration for Y axis
- 6mm 2GT belts for the rest of the axis
- Independent Z stepper motors with Z Tilt capability for the X axis
- Lightweight dual plate carbon fiber bed carriage with integrated tensioner and compatible with different bed sizes
- Rigid bed mount
- High torque LDO-42STH48-2504AC stepper motors running on 36V for the X and Y axis
- Dual power supply supporting 24V and 36V power standards (easily configurable for 48V)
- Driven by the Octopus Pro 1.1 board with TMC2240 drivers
- Running Klipper firmware
- Highly serviceble external electronic box with good air flow, supporting multiple power supplies and configurations.
- Good cable management
- Toolhead based on the Dragon HF and HF extender
  - Custom silicon sock mold available for RTV casting
- LDO Orbiter 2.0 direct drive extruder
- Dual 5015 fan setup for part cooling
- Adopts the [Annex Engineering Quickdraw Probe](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe)
- Minimalistic part design focused on strength and easy printabilty
- Printed in ASA
- Easily enclosed, with the main electronic components outside of the build chamber.
    - In the 200 mm^2 bed configuration it is possible to fully enclose it up to the frame bounding box, with no extra space needed for the bed.
